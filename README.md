# giphy-react-native

Lets users search for giphs related to a topic. Built with React Native.

It is worth noting that this is a buggy app.

I had a bare minimum goal here-- to be able to search for giphs and return them,
building the app with React Native.

And you can check out a video showing this happening in the Android Emulator:

For sure, there seems to be a bug in resetting the search results.
I need to return the state of searchResults array to empty string after returning the giphs.

Also, I played around with scrolling, and not too sure how to get that to work.

But I learned enough about React Native, that I feel good about being able to dive into it,
should I need to in the near future.

For now, I am switching to my final project, as this is the most important focus!

Code is messy-- naming isn't great, comments aren't great, etc. 

Know this isn't my best work-- but I'm juggling all kinds of things at the moment,
and I just wanted to get this to a place that I could move on to the final project!@
